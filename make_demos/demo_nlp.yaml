    Initial Observation: The smallest positive integer that is missing from the array must be between 1 and  n + 1 . Here's why:
    ```
    comment
    Why not less than 1? The definition of "positive integer" implies that any result less than 1 is not valid, as positive integers start from 1.
    Why not more than  n + 1 ? In the worst case, where the array contains a perfect sequence of integers from 1 to  n , the next integer  n + 1  would be the smallest missing positive. If there are any gaps (missing integers) in the sequence before reaching  n , the missing positive integer would have to be less than  n + 1 .
    Confirming the Observation Given that the array can only hold  n  numbers, if all positions from 1 to  n  are filled perfectly by the respective integers, the only number that can be missing is  n + 1 . Conversely, if any of these positions are not filled by the correct integer, the smallest missing positive integer must necessarily be less than  n + 1 , as it must be a number that would fill the first missing gap in the sequence from 1 to  n .

    Lets make sure we understand the problem by creating few examples of our own and make sure this fit our general idea.
    ```
    comment
    nums = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] expected output 1 why ?
    This test case provides a scenario where the array consists only of positive integers that are much larger than the smallest possible positive integer. There is a significant gap right at the beginning of the sequence of positive integers since the array starts from 10. Therefore, the smallest missing positive integer is 1, as there are no numbers filling the initial sequence starting from 1.

    Lets make another one 
    ```
    comment
    nums = [2, 3, 7, 6, 8, -1, -10, 15, 1] expected output 4 why ?
    This test case contains a mix of positive, negative, and unordered numbers. The smallest missing positive integer is 4. This scenario checks the algorithm's efficiency in handling unsorted arrays with a range of values.

    Now when we are more confident about our understanding of the problem and how to tackel it lets try an inital naive approch: To solve the problem naively, we might consider sorting the array and then checking each element to see if it matches its expected value in a sorted list of positive integers. If a discrepancy is found, that is the smallest missing positive. If no discrepancy is found, the smallest missing positive is n+1, where n is the array length.
    ```
    comment
    The naive approach involves sorting the array and then comparing each value to its expected position.

    Let's implement and test this naive approach using a couple of examples. First, we'll write a test function in Python:

    With the code ready, let's execute the `naive_approach.py` script to confirm our naive approach and observe the results.

    We can see that the output matches to the expected outputs which is a good sign so now we can try and improve our solution. To improve on the naive approach, we can avoid sorting by using an auxiliary array T of size n+1 to directly map values from the original array to their indices. This will help us identify the smallest missing positive more efficiently.
    ```
    comment
    The improved approach uses an auxiliary array to check directly for the presence of each number in its index position.

    We can see that again the output matches to the expected outputs which is a good again a sign ,so now we can try and improve our solution even more. Building on our initial observations and improvements, the optimization process involves reordering the original array so that each number is placed in its correct position. If a number doesn't belong between 1 and n, it remains untouched. After this reordering, a final pass checks for the first discrepancy, which will be the smallest missing positive number.
    ```

    This optimization minimizes space usage by reordering the array in place and then scanning for the first missing number.
