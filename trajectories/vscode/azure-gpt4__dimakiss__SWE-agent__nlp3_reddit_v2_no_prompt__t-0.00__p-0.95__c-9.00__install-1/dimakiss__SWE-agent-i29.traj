Divide an Array Into Subarrays With Minimum Cost II\nHere is a programming question, solve it:\n\nYou are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `nums` of length `n`, and two **positive** integers `k` and `dist`.\nThe **cost** of an array is the value of its **first** element. For example, the cost of `[1,2,3]` is `1` while the cost of `[3,4,1]` is `3`.\nYou need to divide `nums` into `k` **disjoint contiguous **subarrays, such that the difference between the starting index of the **second** subarray and the starting index of the `kth` subarray should be **less than or equal to** `dist`. In other words, if you divide `nums` into the subarrays `nums[0..(i1 - 1)], nums[i1..(i2 - 1)], ..., nums[ik-1..(n - 1)]`, then `ik-1 - i1 <= dist`.\nReturn the **minimum** possible sum of the cost of these subarrays.\n\u00a0\n**Example 1:**\nInput: nums = [1,3,2,6,4,2], k = 3, dist = 3\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: The best possible way to divide nums into 3 subarrays is: [1,3], [2,6,4], and [2]. This choice is valid because ik-1 - i1 is 5 - 2 = 3 which is equal to dist. The total cost is nums[0] + nums[2] + nums[5] which is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.\nIt can be shown that there is no possible way to divide nums into 3 subarrays at a cost lower than 5.\n**Example 2:**\nInput: nums = [10,1,2,2,2,1], k = 4, dist = 3\nOutput: 15\nExplanation: The best possible way to divide nums into 4 subarrays is: [10], [1], [2], and [2,2,1]. This choice is valid because ik-1 - i1 is 3 - 1 = 2 which is less than dist. The total cost is nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[3] which is 10 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 15.\nThe division [10], [1], [2,2,2], and [1] is not valid, because the difference between ik-1 and i1 is 5 - 1 = 4, which is greater than dist.\nIt can be shown that there is no possible way to divide nums into 4 subarrays at a cost lower than 15.\n**Example 3:**\nInput: nums = [10,8,18,9], k = 3, dist = 1\nOutput: 36\nExplanation: The best possible way to divide nums into 4 subarrays is: [10], [8], and [18,9]. This choice is valid because ik-1 - i1 is 2 - 1 = 1 which is equal to dist.The total cost is nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] which is 10 + 8 + 18 = 36.\nThe division [10], [8,18], and [9] is not valid, because the difference between ik-1 and i1 is 3 - 1 = 2, which is greater than dist.\nIt can be shown that there is no possible way to divide nums into 3 subarrays at a cost lower than 36.\n\u00a0\n**Constraints:**\n* `3 <= n <= 10^5`\n* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`\n* `3 <= k <= n`\n* `k - 2 <= dist <= n - 2`\n\nHere is how the code submission format should be:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumCost(self, nums: List[int], k: int, dist: int) -> int:\n        \n```\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /dimakiss__SWE-agent)\nbash-$",
