Minimum Moves to Pick K Ones\nHere is a programming question, solve it:\n\nYou are given a binary array `nums` of length `n`, a **positive** integer `k` and a **non-negative** integer `maxChanges`.\nAlice plays a game, where the goal is for Alice to pick up `k` ones from `nums` using the **minimum** number of **moves**. When the game starts, Alice picks up any index `aliceIndex` in the range `[0, n - 1]` and stands there. If `nums[aliceIndex] == 1` , Alice picks up the one and `nums[aliceIndex]` becomes `0`(this **does not** count as a move). After this, Alice can make **any** number of **moves** (**including** **zero**) where in each move Alice must perform **exactly** one of the following actions:\n* Select any index `j != aliceIndex` such that `nums[j] == 0` and set `nums[j] = 1`. This action can be performed **at** **most** `maxChanges` times.\n* Select any two adjacent indices `x` and `y` (`|x - y| == 1`) such that `nums[x] == 1`, `nums[y] == 0`, then swap their values (set `nums[y] = 1` and `nums[x] = 0`). If `y == aliceIndex`, Alice picks up the one after this move and `nums[y]` becomes `0`.\nReturn the **minimum** number of moves required by Alice to pick **exactly **`k` ones.\n\u00a0\n**Example 1:**\n**Input: **nums = [1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1], k = 3, maxChanges = 1\n**Output: **3\n**Explanation:** Alice can pick up `3` ones in `3` moves, if Alice performs the following actions in each move when standing at `aliceIndex == 1`:\n* \u00a0At the start of the game Alice picks up the one and `nums[1]` becomes `0`. `nums` becomes `[1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1]`.\n* Select `j == 2` and perform an action of the first type. `nums` becomes `[1,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1]`\n* Select `x == 2` and `y == 1`, and perform an action of the second type. `nums` becomes `[1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1]`.
