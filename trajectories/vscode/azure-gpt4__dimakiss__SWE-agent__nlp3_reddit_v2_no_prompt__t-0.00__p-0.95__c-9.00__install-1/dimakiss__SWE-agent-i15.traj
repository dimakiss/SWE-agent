Longest Common Suffix Queries\nHere is a programming question, solve it:\n\nYou are given two arrays of strings `wordsContainer` and `wordsQuery`.\nFor each `wordsQuery[i]`, you need to find a string from `wordsContainer` that has the **longest common suffix** with `wordsQuery[i]`. If there are two or more strings in `wordsContainer` that share the longest common suffix, find the string that is the **smallest** in length. If there are two or more such strings that have the **same** smallest length, find the one that occurred **earlier** in `wordsContainer`.\nReturn an array of integers `ans`, where `ans[i]` is the index of the string in `wordsContainer` that has the **longest common suffix** with `wordsQuery[i]`.\n\u00a0\n**Example 1:**\n**Input:** wordsContainer = [\"abcd\",\"bcd\",\"xbcd\"], wordsQuery = [\"cd\",\"bcd\",\"xyz\"]\n**Output:** [1,1,1]\n**Explanation:**\nLet's look at each `wordsQuery[i]` separately:\n* For `wordsQuery[0] = \"cd\"`, strings from `wordsContainer` that share the longest common suffix `\"cd\"` are at indices 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 1 because it has the shortest length of 3.\n* For `wordsQuery[1] = \"bcd\"`, strings from `wordsContainer` that share the longest common suffix `\"bcd\"` are at indices 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 1 because it has the shortest length of 3.\n* For `wordsQuery[2] = \"xyz\"`, there is no string from `wordsContainer` that shares a common suffix. Hence the longest common suffix is `\"\"`, that is shared with strings at index 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 1 because it has the shortest length of 3.\n**Example 2:**\n**Input:** wordsContainer = [\"abcdefgh\",\"poiuygh\",\"ghghgh\"], wordsQuery = [\"gh\",\"acbfgh\",\"acbfegh\"]\n**Output:** [2,0,2]\n**Explanation:**\nLet's look at each `wordsQuery[i]` separately:\n* For `wordsQuery[0] = \"gh\"`, strings from `wordsContainer` that share the longest common suffix `\"gh\"` are at indices 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 2 because it has the shortest length of 6.\n* For `wordsQuery[1] = \"acbfgh\"`, only the string at index 0 shares the longest common suffix `\"fgh\"`. Hence it is the answer, even though the string at index 2 is shorter.\n* For `wordsQuery[2] = \"acbfegh\"`, strings from `wordsContainer` that share the longest common suffix `\"gh\"` are at indices 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 2 because it has the shortest length of 6.\n\u00a0\n**Constraints:**\n* `1 <= wordsContainer.length, wordsQuery.length <= 10^4`\n* `1 <= wordsContainer[i].length <= 5 * 10^3`\n* `1 <= wordsQuery[i].length <= 5 * 10^3`\n* `wordsContainer[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.\n* `wordsQuery[i]` consists only of lowercase English letters.\n* Sum of `wordsContainer[i].length` is at most `5 * 10^5`.\n* Sum of `wordsQuery[i].length` is at most `5 * 10^5`.\n\nHere is how the code submission format should be:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def stringIndices(self, wordsContainer: List[str], wordsQuery: List[str]) -> List[int]:\n        \n```\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /dimakiss__SWE-agent)\nbash-$",
