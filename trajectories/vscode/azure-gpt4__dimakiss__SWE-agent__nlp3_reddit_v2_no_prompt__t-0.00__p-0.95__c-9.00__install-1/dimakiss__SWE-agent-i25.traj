Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command. \nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

Minimum Time to Revert Word to Initial State II\nHere is a programming question, solve it:\n\nYou are given a **0-indexed** string `word` and an integer `k`.\nAt every second, you must perform the following operations:\n* Remove the first `k` characters of `word`.\n* Add any `k` characters to the end of `word`.\n**Note** that you do not necessarily need to add the same characters that you removed. However, you must perform **both** operations at every second.\nReturn the **minimum** time greater than zero required for `word` to revert to its **initial** state.\n\u00a0\n**Example 1:**\nInput: word = \"abacaba\", k = 3\nOutput: 2\nExplanation: At the 1st second, we remove characters \"aba\" from the prefix of word, and add characters \"bac\" to the end of word. Thus, word becomes equal to \"cababac\".\nAt the 2nd second, we remove characters \"cab\" from the prefix of word, and add \"aba\" to the end of word. Thus, word becomes equal to \"abacaba\" and reverts to its initial state.\nIt can be shown that 2 seconds is the minimum time greater than zero required for word to revert to its initial state.\n**Example 2:**\nInput: word = \"abacaba\", k = 4\nOutput: 1\nExplanation: At the 1st second, we remove characters \"abac\" from the prefix of word, and add characters \"caba\" to the end of word. Thus, word becomes equal to \"abacaba\" and reverts to its initial state.\nIt can be shown that 1 second is the minimum time greater than zero required for word to revert to its initial state.\n**Example 3:**\nInput: word = \"abcbabcd\", k = 2\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: At every second, we will remove the first 2 characters of word, and add the same characters to the end of word.\nAfter 4 seconds, word becomes equal to \"abcbabcd\" and reverts to its initial state.\nIt can be shown that 4 seconds is the minimum time greater than zero required for word to revert to its initial state.\n\u00a0\n**Constraints:**\n* `1 <= word.length <= 10^6`\n* `1 <= k <= word.length`\n* `word` consists only of lowercase English letters.\n\nHere is how the code submission format should be:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumTimeToInitialState(self, word: str, k: int) -> int:\n        \n```\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /dimakiss__SWE-agent)\nbash-$",
