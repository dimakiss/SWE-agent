Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command. \nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

Earliest Second to Mark Indices II\nHere is a programming question, solve it:\n\nYou are given two **1-indexed** integer arrays, `nums` and, `changeIndices`, having lengths `n` and `m`, respectively.\nInitially, all indices in `nums` are unmarked. Your task is to mark **all** indices in `nums`.\nIn each second, `s`, in order from `1` to `m` (**inclusive**), you can perform **one** of the following operations:\n* Choose an index `i` in the range `[1, n]` and **decrement** `nums[i]` by `1`.\n* Set `nums[changeIndices[s]]` to any **non-negative** value.\n* Choose an index `i` in the range `[1, n]`, where `nums[i]` is **equal** to `0`, and **mark** index `i`.\n* Do nothing.\nReturn an integer denoting the **earliest second** in the range `[1, m]` when **all** indices in `nums` can be marked by choosing operations optimally, or `-1` if it is impossible.\n\u00a0\n**Example 1:**\nInput: nums = [3,2,3], changeIndices = [1,3,2,2,2,2,3]\nOutput: 6\nExplanation: In this example, we have 7 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices:\nSecond 1: Set nums[changeIndices[1]] to 0. nums becomes [0,2,3].\nSecond 2: Set nums[changeIndices[2]] to 0. nums becomes [0,2,0].\nSecond 3: Set nums[changeIndices[3]] to 0. nums becomes [0,0,0].\nSecond 4: Mark index 1, since nums[1] is equal to 0.\nSecond 5: Mark index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0.\nSecond 6: Mark index 3, since nums[3] is equal to 0.\nNow all indices have been marked.\nIt can be shown that it is not possible to mark all indices earlier than the 6th second.\nHence, the answer is 6.\n**Example 2:**\nInput: nums = [0,0,1,2], changeIndices = [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2]\nOutput: 7\nExplanation: In this example, we have 8 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices:\nSecond 1: Mark index 1, since nums[1] is equal to 0.\nSecond 2: Mark index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0.\nSecond 3: Decrement index 4 by one. nums becomes [0,0,1,1].\nSecond 4: Decrement index 4 by one. nums becomes [0,0,1,0].\nSecond 5: Decrement index 3 by one. nums becomes [0,0,0,0].\nSecond 6: Mark index 3, since nums[3] is equal to 0.\nSecond 7: Mark index 4, since nums[4] is equal to 0.\nNow all indices have been marked.\nIt can be shown that it is not possible to mark all indices earlier than the 7th second.\nHence, the answer is 7.\n**Example 3:**\nInput: nums = [1,2,3], changeIndices = [1,2,3]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation: In this example, it can be shown that it is impossible to mark all indices, as we don't have enough seconds. \nHence, the answer is -1.\n\u00a0\n**Constraints:**\n* `1 <= n == nums.length <= 5000`\n* `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`\n* `1 <= m == changeIndices.length <= 5000`\n* `1 <= changeIndices[i] <= n`\n\nHere is how the code submission format should be:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def earliestSecondToMarkIndices(self, nums: List[int], changeIndices: List[int]) -> int:\n        \n```\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /dimakiss__SWE-agent)\nbash-$",
