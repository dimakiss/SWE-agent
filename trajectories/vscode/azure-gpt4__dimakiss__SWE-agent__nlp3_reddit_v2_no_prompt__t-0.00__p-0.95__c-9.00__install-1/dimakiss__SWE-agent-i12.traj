      "content": "3108. Minimum Cost Walk in Weighted Graph\nHere is a programming question, solve it:\n\nThere is an undirected weighted graph with `n` vertices labeled from `0` to `n - 1`.\nYou are given the integer `n` and an array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi]` indicates that there is an edge between vertices `ui` and `vi` with a weight of `wi`.\nA walk on a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges. The walk starts and ends with a vertex, and each edge connects the vertex that comes before it and the vertex that comes after it. It's important to note that a walk may visit the same edge or vertex more than once.\nThe **cost** of a walk starting at node `u` and ending at node `v` is defined as the bitwise `AND` of the weights of the edges traversed during the walk. In other words, if the sequence of edge weights encountered during the walk is `w0, w1, w2, ..., wk`, then the cost is calculated as `w0 & w1 & w2 & ... & wk`, where `&` denotes the bitwise `AND` operator.\nYou are also given a 2D array `query`, where `query[i] = [si, ti]`. For each query, you need to find the minimum cost of the walk starting at vertex `si` and ending at vertex `ti`. If there exists no such walk, the answer is `-1`.\nReturn the array `answer`, where `answer[i]` denotes the **minimum** cost of a walk for query `i`.\n\u00a0\n**Example 1:**\n**Input:** n = 5, edges = [[0,1,7],[1,3,7],[1,2,1]], query = [[0,3],[3,4]]\n**Output:** [1,-1]\n**Explanation:**\n![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/01/31/q4_example1-1.png)\nTo achieve the cost of 1 in the first query, we need to move on the following edges: `0->1` (weight 7), `1->2` (weight 1), `2->1` (weight 1), `1->3` (weight 7).\nIn the second query, there is no walk between nodes 3 and 4, so the answer is -1.\n**Example 2:**\n**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,2,7],[0,1,15],[1,2,6],[1,2,1]], query = [[1,2]]\n**Output:** [0]\n**Explanation:**\n![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/01/31/q4_example2e.png)\nTo achieve the cost of 0 in the first query, we need to move on the following edges: `1->2` (weight 1), `2->1` (weight 6), `1->2` (weight 1).\n\u00a0\n**Constraints:**\n* `2 <= n <= 10^5`\n* `0 <= edges.length <= 10^5`\n* `edges[i].length == 3`\n* `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1`\n* `ui != vi`\n* `0 <= wi <= 10^5`\n* `1 <= query.length <= 10^5`\n* `query[i].length == 2`\n* `0 <= si, ti <= n - 1`\n* `si !=\u00a0ti`\n\nHere is how the code submission format should be:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumCost(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], query: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:\n        \n```\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /dimakiss__SWE-agent)\nbash-$",
