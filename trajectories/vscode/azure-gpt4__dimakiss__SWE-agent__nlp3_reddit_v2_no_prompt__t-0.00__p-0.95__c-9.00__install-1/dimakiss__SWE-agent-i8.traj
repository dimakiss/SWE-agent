The graph consists of `m` edges represented by a 2D array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ai, bi, wi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` with weight `wi`.\nConsider all the shortest paths from node 0 to node `n - 1` in the graph. You need to find a **boolean** array `answer` where `answer[i]` is `true` if the edge `edges[i]` is part of **at least** one shortest path. Otherwise, `answer[i]` is `false`.\nReturn the array `answer`.\n**Note** that the graph may not be connected.\n\u00a0\n**Example 1:**\n![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/03/05/graph35drawio-1.png)\n**Input:** n = 6, edges = [[0,1,4],[0,2,1],[1,3,2],[1,4,3],[1,5,1],[2,3,1],[3,5,3],[4,5,2]]\n**Output:** [true,true,true,false,true,true,true,false]\n**Explanation:**\nThe following are **all** the shortest paths between nodes 0 and 5:\n* The path `0 -> 1 -> 5`: The sum of weights is `4 + 1 = 5`.\n* The path `0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5`: The sum of weights is `1 + 1 + 3 = 5`.\n* The path `0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 5`: The sum of weights is `1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 5`.\n**Example 2:**\n![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2024/03/05/graphhhh.png)\n**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[2,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,3,4],[3,2,2]]\n**Output:** [true,false,false,true]\n**Explanation:**\nThere is one shortest path between nodes 0 and 3, which is the path `0 -> 2 -> 3` with the sum of weights `1 + 2 = 3`.\n\u00a0\n**Constraints:**\n* `2 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`\n* `m == edges.length`\n* `1 <= m <= min(5 * 10^4, n * (n - 1) / 2)`\n* `0 <= ai, bi < n`\n* `ai != bi`\n* `1 <= wi <= 10^5`\n* There are no repeated edges.\n\nHere is how the code submission format should be:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def findAnswer(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[bool]:\n        \n```\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /dimakiss__SWE-agent)\nbash-$",
