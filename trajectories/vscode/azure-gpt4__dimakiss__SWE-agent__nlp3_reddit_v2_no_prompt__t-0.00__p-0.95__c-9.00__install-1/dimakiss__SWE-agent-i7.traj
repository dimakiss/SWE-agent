The code uses dynamic programming to count the number of valid binary arrays that meet the specified conditions. It also handles the base case where the limit is greater than or equal to the sum of zeros and ones, allowing all permutations to be valid. The results are computed modulo `10^9 + 7` as required.\n\nThe code is now ready for submission.\n\n```\nsubmit\n```",
